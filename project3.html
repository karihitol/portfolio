                                    <p>The third project is in two parts. It's supposed to initiate us to 3D printing and 3D scanning. We had to draw a 3D model and print it, not using more than 100 grams of matter. Then we had to 3D scan a real life object to generate a 3D model</p>
                                    <h3>3D printing</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images2/TIE.webp" alt="" /></span>The reason why we also 3D print and don't just use the cutter is because 3D printers create shapes that the cutter can't. If you want more volume, or a sphere, you have to 3D print. So that is what I thought, I wanted something with a sphere. I had the idea for this project after I had started on project 2, so I decided to stay in the same domain, and do something related to planes. The only "plane" I could think of containing a sphere was the TIE fighter from the Star Wars movies. The shape is pretty simple and memorable. Unfortunately, it's impossible to print <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iGk7MT_0R0">sounds</a>.</p>
                                    <p>So I went on to draw that shape on Fusion360. After that I downloaded Pluraslicer, and imported my file. My first idea was to start printing by the side, but it would've been wrong since the plates on the side would've needed a lot of support. So it's  better to print the ship upright, and include some support below the cockpit. Don't forget to check "Brim".</p>

								    </div>
                                    <p>I uploaded my file on the SD card, slipped it in the printer, selected my file and started printing. Having started printing a little late in the day and the process taking almost 5 hours, I had to come and get my little TIE fighter the next morning. Someone had already taken it off the printer and removed the support. I could just take it and go home with it. Maybe one day when I have time I will paint it to show the glass of the cockpit and the grey things on the wings. Until then I can act like it's a stealth version of the fighter that isn't yet in the movies. Or maybe it's in the background and we can't see it.</p>

                                    <h3>3D scanning</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images2/objet.jpg" alt="" /></span>To 3D scan I looked up "3D scan" on play store and downloaded Polycam. I found this object at home.</p>
                                    <p>I followed polycam's instruction to scan, used the video mode. I clicked on process and this is how the model looks, ready to be exported to any AutoCAD software.</p>

												<h3>Job experiences</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I did two short internships in highschool. My first one in a sports newspaper (l'Equipe) where I learned about different press-related jobs. The second one was in a light manufacture called Loupi. I was mainly doing manual tasks, piecing together light sets, welding, etc. I got my first job after my first year at Háskóli Íslands, in a kindergarten, Leikskólinn Hraunborg. It helped me learn the language better and dealing with children. I worked there again during the next winter break. The next summer I started working in a warehouse for the company 1912, got my forklift certification. The job mainly consists in handling the forklift and preparing orders for restaurants, kitchens, schools, and various businesses. I currently work there two days a week.</p>
